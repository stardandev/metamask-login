# Frontend: Login using your wallet

We want to authenticate using our Metamask wallet. To do this we will make the user sign a message which is exchanged with the backend. The backend will on its turn, respond with an authorization token.

## To start

- Install npm modules in backend using `yarn` or `npm install` and run it using `yarn start` or `npm start`
- Create a frontend using `create-react-app` or anything that you deem fit

## Assignment

Show that you can create the authentication flow. We don't want anything fancy looking, just displaying the authentication token retrieved on the end suffices.

## Handing in

Zip folders but exclude the node_modules folder :)
