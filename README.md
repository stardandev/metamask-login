# Frontend: Login using your wallet

We want to authenticate using our Metamask wallet. To do this we will make the user sign a message which is exchanged with the backend. The backend will on its turn, respond with an authorization token.

## To start

- Install npm modules in backend using `yarn` or `npm install` and run it using `yarn start` or `npm start`
- Install npm modules in frotnend using `yarn` or `npm install` and run it using `yarn start` or `npm start`

## 
- Users can sigin with their Metamask account and the backend will verify it
- In this project, I implement the backend as well as frontend.
